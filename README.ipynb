    "# Data Engineering Project: Formula 1 Stats Exploration\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This project demonstrates data engineering skills by collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing Formula 1 statistics using data sourced from a REST API.\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "Rapid API: JSON data fetched using Postman.\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "### Tools and Services Used\n",
    "* Postman: For fetching data from Rapid API.\n",
    "* Amazon S3: For storing raw and processed data.\n",
    "* AWS Glue: For ETL tasks.\n",
    "* Amazon Athena: For data analysis.\n",
    "* AWS RDS: For database management.\n",
    "* MySQL Workbench: For managing and querying the database.\n",
    "* Apache Spark: For data processing and transformation.\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "* Fetch JSON data from Rapid API using Postman.\n",
    "* Upload JSON data to S3 buckets.\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "* Process and transform JSON data using Apache Spark.\n",
    "* Convert JSON files to Parquet format and store them in S3.\n",
    "### Data Cataloging\n",
    "* Use AWS Glue to create tables from Parquet files.\n",
    "* Query and verify tables using Amazon Athena.\n",
    "### Database Integration\n",
    "* Create an RDS instance and set up MySQL Workbench.\n",
    "* Migrate data from AWS Glue tables to RDS using ETL jobs in AWS Glue Studio.\n",
    "### Data Analysis\n",
    "* Use MySQL Workbench to query the data.\n",
    "* Optionally connect to other visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for advanced analytics.\n",
    "## How to Run the Project\n",
    "* Set up AWS credentials.\n",
    "* Configure and run the data collection scripts in Postman.\n",
    "* Upload JSON data to S3.\n",
    "* Process and transform data using Apache Spark.\n",
    "* Use AWS Glue to catalog the data and create tables.\n",
    "* Set up an RDS instance and configure MySQL Workbench.\n",
    "* Migrate data from AWS Glue to RDS.\n",
    "* Analyze the data using MySQL Workbench or other visualization tools.\n",
    "## Acknowledgments\n",
